# Project Rewrite Complete

## What was done

This project has been completely rewritten to fix the crawler issues and implement a more robust architecture based on the reference project `dw-dengwei/daily-arXiv-ai-enhanced`.

### Key Improvements

1. **Replaced Custom Crawler with Scrapy Framework**
   - The original `arxiv_crawler.py` was inefficient and error-prone
   - New implementation uses Scrapy spider for robust web scraping
   - Better error handling and retry mechanisms

2. **Modular Architecture**
   - `daily_arxiv/`: Scrapy-based crawler for arXiv papers
   - `ai/`: LangChain-based AI enhancement module with structured output
   - `to_md/`: Markdown generation from processed data

3. **Structured AI Output**
   - Uses Pydantic models for consistent AI analysis
   - Structured fields: TL;DR, motivation, method, result, conclusion

4. **Improved Workflow**
   - Single, clean GitHub Actions workflow
   - Better environment variable handling
   - Automatic README updates

### Configuration Required

To use this rewritten project, you need to set up the following GitHub repository secrets and variables:

**Secrets:**
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
- `OPENAI_BASE_URL`: (Optional) Custom OpenAI base URL

**Variables:**
- `CATEGORIES`: Comma-separated categories (e.g., "cs.AI,cs.LG,cs.CV,cs.CL")  
- `LANGUAGE`: Output language (e.g., "English", "Chinese")
- `MODEL_NAME`: LLM model to use (e.g., "gpt-4o-mini")
- `EMAIL`: Your email for Git commits
- `NAME`: Your name for Git commits

### What was removed

The following old files were replaced or are no longer needed:
- `arxiv_crawler.py` (replaced with Scrapy spider)
- `ai_summarizer.py` (replaced with ai/enhance.py)
- `main.py` (replaced with modular approach)
- `simple_main.py` (no longer needed)
- Old workflow files (replaced with single run.yml)
- `config/topics.yaml` (replaced with daily_arxiv/config.yaml)

### Next Steps

1. The old workflow files are still present but disabled
2. The new workflow will run daily at 16:30 UTC
3. You can manually trigger the workflow to test it
4. The system will generate daily markdown reports in the `data/` directory
5. README.md will be automatically updated with links to new reports

The project is now ready to run and should be much more reliable than the previous implementation.
